Promote the south of Belgium. 
This is part of my end-of-year eaxmination for the German Language course at Ihecs in 3rd year (BAC3)).
Being in a communication school, we were tasked to design a logo, slogan and communication strategy for a tourism bureau in the southern, German-speaking part of belgium. 
Having some coding skills we went the extra mile with this website presenting our ability to handle a brand's communication strategy, choosing its visual identity as well as its logo, finding and writting the content we wanted to display and choosing the right way of presenting it to its public, using the right tools.
